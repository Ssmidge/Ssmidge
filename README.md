Helloo everyone, My name is Adrian. I'm a Systems Administrator & Developer
and I mainly program NodeJS. I like to watch anime, and code all day.
Basically, if I'm not coding, I'm watching anime or sleeping xD

[JavaScript](https://nodejs.org) is not the only language I know, I often use typescript to code some random discord bot
and known Windows exploits and test them on my personal PC (risky, i know :smile:). I also
work with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and use [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

I'm currently working on random stuff, I love to test it out on my homelab (powered by a Dell PowerEdge R620 and some old computers!)
